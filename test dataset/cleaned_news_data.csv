"Europe saved its predators from the brink of extinction.

It was roe deer rutting season in southern Slovakia, and the hills below the Carpathian mountains were busy with tourists biking and foraging for mushrooms. Fellow hunters who had come face to face with bears had told<strong> </strong>Supeková the fear had been so great they could not lift their rifles. Sitting with her father, a hunter in his 80s who had killed a few bears, she found herself in a similar state of dread – she was out on that trip expecting to kill deer, and did not want to come on a bear unexpectedly.</p><p>“Fear permeated me … the smell penetrated to the tip of my bones,” says Supeková, the founder of the Club of Slovak Lady Hunters.

The hell and horror of cow attacks: ‘I told my husband to leave me to die’,"<p>Cattle are the most common cause of death in the UK farming industry – with some figures suggesting cows kill more people than dogs. So what can you do if the herd approaches?</p><p>“I remember feeling I was about to die,” says Jill Gilmore. She and her husband, Mark, were walking their dog, Finnegan, in the Stockport area and had just climbed over a stile on a public footpath. Jill was slightly ahead, with Finnegan on a short lead, when a group of cows appeared. “It was just instant,” she says: the herd of 20 or 30 cows attacked her, butting her to the ground. She doesn’t remember the details, just snippets: hooves coming down on her and an acceptance that she was dying. “I had kind of relaxed,” she says. “Then Mark came up to me and just absolutely shouted at me to get up. He helped me up, got my arms around his neck.” He tried to get them hurriedly out of the field, dragging her under a gap in the fence, conscious the cows could attack again. She finds it easier to talk about than Mark does, she says. “He actually witnessed it.” She told him to leave her to die, he says.</p><p>The cows had broken both sides of Gilmore’s pelvis, 12 ribs and two bones in her neck and her arm, her lungs were damaged and she had head and ankle injuries. She underwent three days of surgery and spent two weeks in intensive care (“the worst part,” she says), for 10 days of which she was on a ventilator. After that came three months of hospital rehab, much of it with a “massive external fixator on my pelvis, like a scaffolding frame”, which meant she could not move or even roll independently. “My dignity was really taken away from me.”</p> <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/sep/12/the-hell-and-horror-of-cow-attacks-i-told-my-husband-to-leave-me-to-die"">Continue reading...</a>",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/sep/12/the-hell-and-horror-of-cow-attacks-i-told-my-husband-to-leave-me-to-die,cattle are the most common cause of death in the uk farming industry  with some figures suggesting cows kill more people than dogs so what can you do if the herd approachesi remember feeling i was about to die says jill gilmore she and her husband mark were walking their dog finnegan in the stockport area and had just climbed over a stile on a public footpath jill was slightly ahead with finnegan on a short lead when a group of cows appeared it was just instant she says the herd of 20 or 30 cows attacked her butting her to the ground she doesnt remember the details just snippets hooves coming down on her and an acceptance that she was dying i had kind of relaxed she says then mark came up to me and just absolutely shouted at me to get up he helped me up got my arms around his neck he tried to get them hurriedly out of the field dragging her under a gap in the fence conscious the cows could attack again she finds it easier to talk about than mark does she says he actually witnessed it she told him to leave her to die he saysthe cows had broken both sides of gilmores pelvis 12 ribs and two bones in her neck and her arm her lungs were damaged and she had head and ankle injuries she underwent three days of surgery and spent two weeks in intensive care the worst part she says for 10 days of which she was on a ventilator after that came three months of hospital rehab much of it with a massive external fixator on my pelvis like a scaffolding frame which meant she could not move or even roll independently my dignity was really taken away from me continue reading,cattle common cause death uk farming industry figure suggesting cow kill people dog herd approachesi remember feeling die say jill gilmore husband mark walking dog finnegan stockport area climbed stile public footpath jill slightly ahead finnegan short lead group cow appeared instant say herd 20 30 cow attacked butting ground doesnt remember detail snippet hoof coming acceptance dying kind relaxed say mark came absolutely shouted get helped got arm around neck tried get hurriedly field dragging gap fence conscious cow could attack find easier talk mark say actually witnessed told leave die saysthe cow broken side gilmores pelvis 12 rib two bone neck arm lung damaged head ankle injury underwent three day surgery spent two week intensive care worst part say 10 day ventilator came three month hospital rehab much massive external fixator pelvis like scaffolding frame meant could move even roll independently dignity really taken away continue reading

‘I’ll have them with hot sauce’: should vegans eat oysters?,"<p>Bivalve veganism is built on the philosophy that molluscs such as mussels and oysters feel no pain. But some say the scientific jury is still out</p><p>Alex Karol is fantasising about the next time she gets to slurp up some freshly shucked oysters. “I’ll have them with lemon juice, shallots, and a couple of drops of hot sauce. Sometimes, I have a couple with a splash of vodka,” says the London- and Toronto-based publicist. Cost curbs her craving for oysters to one meal a month, and so even just talking about them makes her hungry. “I really, really enjoy them – like, properly enjoy them. I wish that I had oysters every single day of my life.”</p><p>Oysters are not to everyone’s taste but Karol’s enthusiasm for the filter-feeding bivalves comes as a surprise – because she is vegan. She is otherwise strict: she does not even consume honey. But a few years back she found she was struggling to get certain nutrients in suitable quantities from plants alone, and someone tipped her off to the idea that you could eat oysters and still be vegan. It was called “bivalve veganism” – and Karol was sold.</p> <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/sep/12/ill-have-them-with-hot-sauce-should-vegans-eat-oysters"">Continue reading...</a>",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/sep/12/ill-have-them-with-hot-sauce-should-vegans-eat-oysters,bivalve veganism is built on the philosophy that molluscs such as mussels and oysters feel no pain but some say the scientific jury is still outalex karol is fantasising about the next time she gets to slurp up some freshly shucked oysters ill have them with lemon juice shallots and a couple of drops of hot sauce sometimes i have a couple with a splash of vodka says the london and torontobased publicist cost curbs her craving for oysters to one meal a month and so even just talking about them makes her hungry i really really enjoy them  like properly enjoy them i wish that i had oysters every single day of my lifeoysters are not to everyones taste but karols enthusiasm for the filterfeeding bivalves comes as a surprise  because she is vegan she is otherwise strict she does not even consume honey but a few years back she found she was struggling to get certain nutrients in suitable quantities from plants alone and someone tipped her off to the idea that you could eat oysters and still be vegan it was called bivalve veganism  and karol was sold continue reading,bivalve veganism built philosophy mollusc mussel oyster feel pain say scientific jury still outalex karol fantasising next time get slurp freshly shucked oyster ill lemon juice shallot couple drop hot sauce sometimes couple splash vodka say london torontobased publicist cost curb craving oyster one meal month even talking make hungry really really enjoy like properly enjoy wish oyster every single day lifeoysters everyones taste karols enthusiasm filterfeeding bivalve come surprise vegan otherwise strict even consume honey year back found struggling get certain nutrient suitable quantity plant alone someone tipped idea could eat oyster still vegan called bivalve veganism karol sold continue reading

Billionaire Island review – like Succession … with salmon farmers,"<p>Sadly it’s not a reality show where the 1% battle for survival. No, this is a wry, droll and incredibly understated Norwegian family saga about tasty pink fish</p><p>Billionaire Island! The title promises so much. A daring new reality show, perhaps, where the world’s filthiest capitalists compete to see who can survive the longest on an uninhabited Alaska islet. Episode five: an increasingly feral Richard Branson reacts poorly to the Duke of Westminster’s attempt to levy a tax on raindrops. Episode 28: the contestants vote to eat Mark Zuckerberg, only to find his innards are silicon.</p><p>Calm down, it’s not that. Billionaire Island is the English translation of Milliardærøya, which is … a Norwegian dramedy about salmon farming. It is about wealthy people – the characters are the dominant entrepreneurs on an island that is a leading player in the global fishing industry – and the story combines a struggle for corporate power with family drama. In other words, Succession with salmon. But the series, created by Lilyhammer showrunners Anne Bjørnstad and Eilif Skodvin, feels very Norwegian in its outlook and humour. It is dry, wry and droll.

"The Guardian view on the US presidential debate: Kamala Harris’s triumph isn’t transformative, but it was essential | Editorial","<p>Donald Trump was unable to resist the vice-president’s goading.

The Story of a Heart by Rachel Clarke review – a doctor’s remarkable account of an organ transplant,"<p>The extraordinary journey of a young girl’s heart to a young boy’s body is told in an accessible, humane way</p><p>In 2017, a nine-year-old girl from Devon was involved in a car crash that left her with a catastrophic brain injury. Keira had been a keen horse rider who loved animals, and would go out of her way to rescue insects in distress. After her family were told she was brain dead they immediately asked if she would be able to donate her organs, knowing it was what she would have wanted.</p><p>As Keira lay in intensive care, a young boy from Cheshire was on his eighth month in hospital with a dangerously enlarged heart. Before he became ill, nine-year-old Max loved to play football, climb trees and wrestle with his friends. But now, with acute cardiomyopathy brought on by a viral infection, Max was painfully thin and being kept alive with a mechanical heart pump. Not only did he not have the strength to leave his bed but, on his darkest days, he didn’t want to live. He and his family knew his heart could give out at any minute and his only hope was a transplant.</p> <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/books/article/2024/sep/12/the-story-of-a-heart-by-rachel-clarke-review-a-doctors-remarkable-account-of-an-organ-transplant"">Continue reading...</a>",https://www.theguardian.com/books/article/2024/sep/12/the-story-of-a-heart-by-rachel-clarke-review-a-doctors-remarkable-account-of-an-organ-transplant,the extraordinary journey of a young girls heart to a young boys body is told in an accessible humane wayin 2017 a nineyearold girl from devon was involved in a car crash that left her with a catastrophic brain injury keira had been a keen horse rider who loved animals and would go out of her way to rescue insects in distress after her family were told she was brain dead they immediately asked if she would be able to donate her organs knowing it was what she would have wantedas keira lay in intensive care a young boy from cheshire was on his eighth month in hospital with a dangerously enlarged heart before he became ill nineyearold max loved to play football climb trees and wrestle with his friends but now with acute cardiomyopathy brought on by a viral infection max was painfully thin and being kept alive with a mechanical heart pump not only did he not have the strength to leave his bed but on his darkest days he didnt want to live he and his family knew his heart could give out at any minute and his only hope was a transplant continue reading,extraordinary journey young girl heart young boy body told accessible humane wayin 2017 nineyearold girl devon involved car crash left catastrophic brain injury keira keen horse rider loved animal would go way rescue insect distress family told brain dead immediately asked would able donate organ knowing would wantedas keira lay intensive care young boy cheshire eighth month hospital dangerously enlarged heart became ill nineyearold max loved play football climb tree wrestle friend acute cardiomyopathy brought viral infection max painfully thin kept alive mechanical heart pump strength leave bed darkest day didnt want live family knew heart could give minute hope transplant continue reading

"Into the Fire: The Lost Daughter review – a staggering, mesmerising true-crime tale","<p>When Cathy Terkanian learned that the daughter she was persuaded to place up for adoption had gone missing, she knew the police would never bother to find her. So she did it herself</p><p>I feel like it’s been quite a while – 10, maybe even 20 minutes? – since Netflix’s last addition to the true crime genre (AKA an anthology of male violence against women and girls), but Into the Fire: The Lost Daughter is worth the wait, in the strange and twisted way of these voyeuristic endeavours anyway.</p><p>It is the story of Cathy Terkanian’s search for her adopted daughter Alexis (renamed Aundria by her new parents, Brenda and Dennis Bowman). It began in 2010, when she got a letter asking if she could give a DNA sample to the police in case an unidentified woman’s brutalised body they had found was Aundria’s.

‘Now I owned a private war’: Lee Miller and the female journalists who broke battlefield rules,"<p>Evading detention and ‘the convenience question’, stowing away and sweet-talking soldiers, Miller and her cohort were able to deliver some of the most striking reporting of the second world war</p><p>In August 1944, the photographer and war journalist Lee Miller was sent to France to report on conditions in the newly liberated port city of Saint-Malo in Brittany. But, as it rapidly became clear, some intelligence wires had got crossed. Far from being liberated, much of Saint-Malo was still a violent war zone, with US soldiers under heavy fire as they battled to dislodge the occupying Germans.</p><p>At this point in the second world war, around 200 women had, like Miller, gained military accreditation with the allied forces. Yet as Miller well knew, none of them were meant to be reporting on scenes of actual fighting, since their brief was simply to write the “softer” stories of war, about hospitals, air raid wardens and civilian heroism. If Miller chose to remain in Saint-Malo, she would certainly be punished, yet it was too fabulous an opportunity for her to miss. “I was the only photographer for miles around,” she said, “and now I owned a private war.” For five exhilarating days, aided and abetted by the Americans and sometimes coming under fire herself, she observed and photographed everything.</p> <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/film/article/2024/sep/11/now-i-owned-a-private-war-lee-miller-and-the-female-journalists-who-broke-battlefield-rules"">Continue reading...</a>",https://www.theguardian.com/film/article/2024/sep/11/now-i-owned-a-private-war-lee-miller-and-the-female-journalists-who-broke-battlefield-rules,evading detention and the convenience question stowing away and sweettalking soldiers miller and her cohort were able to deliver some of the most striking reporting of the second world warin august 1944 the photographer and war journalist lee miller was sent to france to report on conditions in the newly liberated port city of saintmalo in brittany but as it rapidly became clear some intelligence wires had got crossed far from being liberated much of saintmalo was still a violent war zone with us soldiers under heavy fire as they battled to dislodge the occupying germansat this point in the second world war around 200 women had like miller gained military accreditation with the allied forces yet as miller well knew none of them were meant to be reporting on scenes of actual fighting since their brief was simply to write the softer stories of war about hospitals air raid wardens and civilian heroism if miller chose to remain in saintmalo she would certainly be punished yet it was too fabulous an opportunity for her to miss i was the only photographer for miles around she said and now i owned a private war for five exhilarating days aided and abetted by the americans and sometimes coming under fire herself she observed and photographed everything continue reading,evading detention convenience question stowing away sweettalking soldier miller cohort able deliver striking reporting second world warin august 1944 photographer war journalist lee miller sent france report condition newly liberated port city saintmalo brittany rapidly became clear intelligence wire got crossed far liberated much saintmalo still violent war zone u soldier heavy fire battled dislodge occupying germansat point second world war around 200 woman like miller gained military accreditation allied force yet miller well knew none meant reporting scene actual fighting since brief simply write softer story war hospital air raid warden civilian heroism miller chose remain saintmalo would certainly punished yet fabulous opportunity miss photographer mile around said owned private war five exhilarating day aided abetted american sometimes coming fire observed photographed everything continue reading

A moment that changed me: losing my sight was devastating – until my brother pranked me with a spider,"<p>When an eye condition left me blind at 21, I went from being confident and outgoing to bad-tempered and distrustful. But a joke gave me a new perspective</p><p>In 2008, I was going through one of the most difficult periods of my life. I had been working as a waitress in a cocktail bar when I suddenly went blind. One minute I was serving a martini; the next, large black blobs were floating across my peripheral vision. Then, over the next few hours, I was plunged into total darkness.</p><p>I have had a chronic eye condition since I was three years old: <a href=""https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/uveitis/"">uveitis</a>, which causes inflammation inside the eye, and secondary <a href=""https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/glaucoma/"">glaucoma</a>, which involves damage to the optic nerve. In my mid-teens, I lost sight in my left eye; now, at 21 years old, the right eye had followed suit. To add insult to injury, the recession had kicked in, leaving me skint and unemployed. I was forced to move out of London, the city I adored, and back in with my family in Berkshire.

"‘I regret being a little bit poor’: Doon Mackichan on stardom, Smack the Pony and never selling out","<p>As an actor and comedian, she has worked with some patronising colleagues and creepy directors – but has always played the game on her own terms. She discusses Botox, nudity, universal credit and life as an uncompromising artist</p><p>One of my favourite moments from Doon Mackichan’s memoir is the day she auditions for a part in a hit sitcom. Waiting for her turn in a church hall in central London, she was already annoyed at the way the role was written – a “cougar”, an older woman trying to ensnare a younger man, who was, says Mackichan, portrayed as “desperate and ridiculous”. The director – someone she knew and had thought of as a friend – was standoffish, “playing the director power game”. She had to read the part several times, trying – and failing – to subvert it, the people in charge looking bored. Mackichan announced she was leaving, but flustered by her rage, she couldn’t find the exit. She slammed open the fire doors instead, setting off the alarms. I can picture her, angry but elated, standing on Tottenham Court Road with her two middle fingers up. It was the day she vowed never to audition for comedy again.</p><p>Mackichan has a history of being gloriously uncompromising. As a young actor: no nudity. As a working mother of three: demanding time on set to breastfeed and money for childcare. As a jobbing actor: turning down parts, such as the offer to play a murder victim, when she remains appalled at how many dead women there are on screen. And now, as a 62-year-old: refusing to do anything to her face, despite it being suggested that she have a little “freshen” up.</p> <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/article/2024/sep/11/i-regret-being-a-little-bit-poor-doon-mackichan-on-stardom-smack-the-pony-and-never-selling-out"">Continue reading...</a>",https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/article/2024/sep/11/i-regret-being-a-little-bit-poor-doon-mackichan-on-stardom-smack-the-pony-and-never-selling-out,as an actor and comedian she has worked with some patronising colleagues and creepy directors  but has always played the game on her own terms she discusses botox nudity universal credit and life as an uncompromising artistone of my favourite moments from doon mackichans memoir is the day she auditions for a part in a hit sitcom waiting for her turn in a church hall in central london she was already annoyed at the way the role was written  a cougar an older woman trying to ensnare a younger man who was says mackichan portrayed as desperate and ridiculous the director  someone she knew and had thought of as a friend  was standoffish playing the director power game she had to read the part several times trying  and failing  to subvert it the people in charge looking bored mackichan announced she was leaving but flustered by her rage she couldnt find the exit she slammed open the fire doors instead setting off the alarms i can picture her angry but elated standing on tottenham court road with her two middle fingers up it was the day she vowed never to audition for comedy againmackichan has a history of being gloriously uncompromising as a young actor no nudity as a working mother of three demanding time on set to breastfeed and money for childcare as a jobbing actor turning down parts such as the offer to play a murder victim when she remains appalled at how many dead women there are on screen and now as a 62yearold refusing to do anything to her face despite it being suggested that she have a little freshen up continue reading,actor comedian worked patronising colleague creepy director always played game term discus botox nudity universal credit life uncompromising artistone favourite moment doon mackichans memoir day audition part hit sitcom waiting turn church hall central london already annoyed way role written cougar older woman trying ensnare younger man say mackichan portrayed desperate ridiculous director someone knew thought friend standoffish playing director power game read part several time trying failing subvert people charge looking bored mackichan announced leaving flustered rage couldnt find exit slammed open fire door instead setting alarm picture angry elated standing tottenham court road two middle finger day vowed never audition comedy againmackichan history gloriously uncompromising young actor nudity working mother three demanding time set breastfeed money childcare jobbing actor turning part offer play murder victim remains appalled many dead woman screen 62yearold refusing anything face despite suggested little freshen continue reading
Holly Johnson on orgasmic pop and his second coming: ‘It’s a miracle of modern science I’m still here’,"<p>His band, Frankie Goes to Hollywood, ruled the charts in the 1980s with their libidinous, unapologetically queer songs. Then he was told he had months to live. As a new exhibition celebrates Johnson’s art and influence, he tells the hidden story</p><p>It’s a pop fact that four of the top 10 bestselling singles ever in Britain were written and performed by gay men: George Michael (at No 9 with Wham’s Last Christmas); Freddie Mercury (No 3 with Queen’s Bohemian Rhapsody); Elton John (No 1 with Candle in the Wind). The fourth is Holly Johnson, leather-clad singer of <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/aug/28/frankie-goes-to-hollywood-30-years-welcome-to-the-pleasuredome"">Frankie Goes to Hollywood</a>, whose libidinous banger Relax sold over two million copies, and is still the sixth biggest UK single ever.</p><p>“I feel quite humble that I’m among such illustrious company,” Johnson says, his scouse accent undiminished by decades down south. He’s in the function room of a posh pub near his house in west London, dressed in black, with a swept-back white quiff and clunky clear Perspex glasses by the fashion brand Jacquemus. “I used to see Freddie in clubs but I was much too shy to approach him.
