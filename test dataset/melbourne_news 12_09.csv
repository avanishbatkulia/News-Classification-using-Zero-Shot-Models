The hell and horror of cow attacks: ‘I told my husband to leave me to die’,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/sep/12/the-hell-and-horror-of-cow-attacks-i-told-my-husband-to-leave-me-to-die,,"<p>Cattle are the most common cause of death in the UK farming industry – with some figures suggesting cows kill more people than dogs. So what can you do if the herd approaches?</p><p>“I remember feeling I was about to die,” says Jill Gilmore. She and her husband, Mark, were walking their dog, Finnegan, in the Stockport area and had just climbed over a stile on a public footpath. Jill was slightly ahead, with Finnegan on a short lead, when a group of cows appeared. “It was just instant,” she says: the herd of 20 or 30 cows attacked her, butting her to the ground. She doesn’t remember the details, just snippets: hooves coming down on her and an acceptance that she was dying. “I had kind of relaxed,” she says. “Then Mark came up to me and just absolutely shouted at me to get up. He helped me up, got my arms around his neck.” He tried to get them hurriedly out of the field, dragging her under a gap in the fence, conscious the cows could attack again. She finds it easier to talk about than Mark does, she says. “He actually witnessed it.” She told him to leave her to die, he says.</p><p>The cows had broken both sides of Gilmore’s pelvis, 12 ribs and two bones in her neck and her arm, her lungs were damaged and she had head and ankle injuries. She underwent three days of surgery and spent two weeks in intensive care (“the worst part,” she says), for 10 days of which she was on a ventilator. After that came three months of hospital rehab, much of it with a “massive external fixator on my pelvis, like a scaffolding frame”, which meant she could not move or even roll independently. “My dignity was really taken away from me.”</p> <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/sep/12/the-hell-and-horror-of-cow-attacks-i-told-my-husband-to-leave-me-to-die"">Continue reading...</a>",The Guardian

If Miller chose to remain in Saint-Malo, she would certainly be punished, yet it was too fabulous an opportunity for her to miss. “I was the only photographer for miles around,” she said, “and now I owned a private war.” For five exhilarating days, aided and abetted by the Americans and sometimes coming under fire herself, she observed and photographed everything.</p> <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/film/article/2024/sep/11/now-i-owned-a-private-war-lee-miller-and-the-female-journalists-who-broke-battlefield-rules"">Continue reading...</a>",The Guardian

Any night of the week, you can wander downtown and find live music playing somewhere – from the set of a live television show to a pop-up concert in a convenience store, not to mention incredible cuisine and nightlife where people never take themselves too seriously. We chatted with Madeline Hollern, editor of Austin Monthly, to get her latest favourite recommendations for visitors.</p><p><strong>Food and drink<br /></strong>Though Austin was always a great place for food trucks and burger joints, Hollern says she’s seen more options opening up from new restaurants in the city this year. “We’re getting more diversity in terms of types of food and price points, which is very welcome,” she says. One of her favourite new restaurants is <a href=""https://www.austintexas.org/listings/bambino/14613/"" rel=""nofollow"">Bambino</a>, a pizza restaurant offering hand-tossed pies with a daily changing menu in East Austin.<br /><br />

But a joke gave me a new perspective</p><p>In 2008, I was going through one of the most difficult periods of my life. I had been working as a waitress in a cocktail bar when I suddenly went blind. One minute I was serving a martini; the next, large black blobs were floating across my peripheral vision. Then, over the next few hours, I was plunged into total darkness.</p><p>I have had a chronic eye condition since I was three years old: <a href=""https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/uveitis/"">uveitis</a>, which causes inflammation inside the eye, and secondary <a href=""https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/glaucoma/"">glaucoma</a>, which involves damage to the optic nerve. In my mid-teens, I lost sight in my left eye; now, at 21 years old, the right eye had followed suit. To add insult to injury, the recession had kicked in, leaving me skint and unemployed. I was forced to move out of London, the city I adored, and back in with my family in Berkshire. Losing my independence just after I graduated from university hadn’t been part of the plan.</p> <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/article/2024/sep/11/a-moment-that-changed-me-losing-sight-devastating-until-brother-pranked-me-with-spider"">Continue reading...</a>",The Guardian
"‘I regret being a little bit poor’: Doon Mackichan on stardom, Smack the Pony and never selling out",https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/article/2024/sep/11/i-regret-being-a-little-bit-poor-doon-mackichan-on-stardom-smack-the-pony-and-never-selling-out,,"<p>As an actor and comedian, she has worked with some patronising colleagues and creepy directors – but has always played the game on her own terms. She discusses Botox, nudity, universal credit and life as an uncompromising artist</p><p>One of my favourite moments from Doon Mackichan’s memoir is the day she auditions for a part in a hit sitcom. Waiting for her turn in a church hall in central London, she was already annoyed at the way the role was written – a “cougar”, an older woman trying to ensnare a younger man, who was, says Mackichan, portrayed as “desperate and ridiculous”. The director – someone she knew and had thought of as a friend – was standoffish, “playing the director power game”. She had to read the part several times, trying – and failing – to subvert it, the people in charge looking bored. Mackichan announced she was leaving, but flustered by her rage, she couldn’t find the exit. She slammed open the fire doors instead, setting off the alarms. I can picture her, angry but elated, standing on Tottenham Court Road with her two middle fingers up. It was the day she vowed never to audition for comedy again.</p><p>Mackichan has a history of being gloriously uncompromising. As a young actor: no nudity. As a working mother of three: demanding time on set to breastfeed and money for childcare. As a jobbing actor: turning down parts, such as the offer to play a murder victim, when she remains appalled at how many dead women there are on screen. And now, as a 62-year-old: refusing to do anything to her face, despite it being suggested that she have a little “freshen” up.</p> <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/article/2024/sep/11/i-regret-being-a-little-bit-poor-doon-mackichan-on-stardom-smack-the-pony-and-never-selling-out"">Continue reading...</a>",The Guardian
Holly Johnson on orgasmic pop and his second coming: ‘It’s a miracle of modern science I’m still here’,https://www.theguardian.com/music/article/2024/sep/11/holly-johnson-on-orgasmic-pop-and-his-second-coming-its-a-miracle-of-modern-science-im-still-here,,"<p>His band, Frankie Goes to Hollywood, ruled the charts in the 1980s with their libidinous, unapologetically queer songs. Then he was told he had months to live. As a new exhibition celebrates Johnson’s art and influence, he tells the hidden story</p><p>It’s a pop fact that four of the top 10 bestselling singles ever in Britain were written and performed by gay men: George Michael (at No 9 with Wham’s Last Christmas); Freddie Mercury (No 3 with Queen’s Bohemian Rhapsody); Elton John (No 1 with Candle in the Wind). The fourth is Holly Johnson, leather-clad singer of <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/aug/28/frankie-goes-to-hollywood-30-years-welcome-to-the-pleasuredome"">Frankie Goes to Hollywood</a>, whose libidinous banger Relax sold over two million copies, and is still the sixth biggest UK single ever.</p><p>“I feel quite humble that I’m among such illustrious company,” Johnson says, his scouse accent undiminished by decades down south. He’s in the function room of a posh pub near his house in west London, dressed in black, with a swept-back white quiff and clunky clear Perspex glasses by the fashion brand Jacquemus. “I used to see Freddie in clubs but I was much too shy to approach him. Elton John once took me to dinner and George Michael was there, but we didn’t click. They were such megastars – I never felt in their league.”</p> <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/music/article/2024/sep/11/holly-johnson-on-orgasmic-pop-and-his-second-coming-its-a-miracle-of-modern-science-im-still-here"">Continue reading...</a>",The Guardian
