The Cure: Alone review – majestically wreathed in misery and despair,"<p><strong>(Fiction/Polydor)</strong><br />Birds fall from the sky, broken voices call us home and youthful dreams are dashed against the transience of life in the band’s first new song in 16 years</p><p>As every <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/music/the-cure"">Cure</a> fan knows, the band’s albums exist somewhere on a sliding scale between two extremes. At one end lurk the albums on which Robert Smith gives free rein to his natural facility for pop songwriting: The Head on the Door, Wish, the oft-reviled Wild Mood Swings. At the other are the albums on which one imagines Smith thinks his legacy really rests: pitch-black explorations of existential despair on which songs sprawl lengthily and radio-friendly melodies are in short supply, 1982’s notorious Pornography and 2000’s Bloodflowers among them. In a world where the actual singles chart no longer really matters to a band like the Cure – their period as reliable, if idiosyncratic hitmakers drew to a close in the mid-90s, a change in status that had no effect whatsoever on their capacity to fill stadiums and arenas – their first new single in 16 years suggests their forthcoming album Songs of a Lost World tends towards the second category.</p><p>Alone is the best part of seven minutes long, and more than half of that time is consumed by a lengthy instrumental introduction: the first track on the forthcoming album, its structure brings to mind Plainsong, the opener from 1989’s career highpoint Disintegration. There’s something deliberately disjointed about its sound: Simon Gallup’s bass doesn’t drive the song so much as decorate it with distorted retorts; the glacial synth and a very Cure-esque guitar line come and go, and there are moments when the whole enterprise feels on the verge of falling apart. It has a beautiful, rather majestic-sounding chord sequence – even at their bleakest, the Cure were almost never tuneless – but it is funereally paced and somehow sounds even slower still because the rhythm track features no hi-hats, just the pounding of a bass drum and snare and the occasional cathartic cymbal crash. If you’re after a comparison from the Cure’s past for that aspect of its sound, you could do worse than think of the similarly brutal and austere drums that underpin Pornography, most specifically Cold.</p> <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/music/2024/sep/26/the-cure-alone-review"">Continue reading...</a>",https://www.theguardian.com/music/2024/sep/26/the-cure-alone-review,fictionpolydorbirds fall from the sky broken voices call us home and youthful dreams are dashed against the transience of life in the bands first new song in 16 yearsas every cure fan knows the bands albums exist somewhere on a sliding scale between two extremes at one end lurk the albums on which robert smith gives free rein to his natural facility for pop songwriting the head on the door wish the oftreviled wild mood swings at the other are the albums on which one imagines smith thinks his legacy really rests pitchblack explorations of existential despair on which songs sprawl lengthily and radiofriendly melodies are in short supply 1982s notorious pornography and 2000s bloodflowers among them in a world where the actual singles chart no longer really matters to a band like the cure  their period as reliable if idiosyncratic hitmakers drew to a close in the mid90s a change in status that had no effect whatsoever on their capacity to fill stadiums and arenas  their first new single in 16 years suggests their forthcoming album songs of a lost world tends towards the second categoryalone is the best part of seven minutes long and more than half of that time is consumed by a lengthy instrumental introduction the first track on the forthcoming album its structure brings to mind plainsong the opener from 1989s career highpoint disintegration theres something deliberately disjointed about its sound simon gallups bass doesnt drive the song so much as decorate it with distorted retorts the glacial synth and a very cureesque guitar line come and go and there are moments when the whole enterprise feels on the verge of falling apart it has a beautiful rather majesticsounding chord sequence  even at their bleakest the cure were almost never tuneless  but it is funereally paced and somehow sounds even slower still because the rhythm track features no hihats just the pounding of a bass drum and snare and the occasional cathartic cymbal crash if youre after a comparison from the cures past for that aspect of its sound you could do worse than think of the similarly brutal and austere drums that underpin pornography most specifically cold continue reading,non crime

Grotesquerie review – horror as gorily unsubtle as you’d expect from Ryan Murphy,"<p>This tasteless, grisly, state-of-the-nation tale is certainly bold. Who knows what it’ll be like when Travis Kelce makes his long-awaited acting debut later in the series?</p><p>It might seem odd to suggest that Grotesquerie, the latest show from the ubiquitous, never knowingly understated Ryan Murphy (who co-creates and co-writes here), is more downbeat than his usual horror fodder. There are four highly theatrical massacres in the first two episodes alone, and a body count so vast that the number of corpses might outweigh the members of the living, breathing cast. Yet it is different to many of his other projects, which tend to err on the side of spectacle for spectacle’s sake. This is clearly grappling for a grander narrative in the gothic horrors on display.</p><p>Those horrors are plentiful. Niecy Nash is Lois Tryon, a no-nonsense, hard-drinking detective with a complicated family life, all of which are the basic entry requirements for a female TV cop. You can practically see “she sighs wearily” written into the script, though Nash shoulders her well-worn cynicism with poise.

Killer Heat review – overcooked Jo Nesbø adaptation is deathly dull,"<p>Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Shailene Woodley star in a very boring murder mystery streaming on Amazon</p><p>What might seem like a relatively easy ask on paper – the director of a buzzy festival hit adapting a Jo Nesbø short story with three likable and attractive actors set on the camera-ready island of Crete – has become a bizarrely effortful slog in the misshape of Killer Heat, a dull and predictable sunshine noir that wastes the time of those involved as well as ours.</p><p>Originally known as the far more appealing The Jealousy Man in print, the anonymously retitled mystery plays less like a real movie and more like a case-of-the-week episode of an ITV crime drama (without credits it’s not even 90 minutes long). Joseph Gordon-Levitt, revisiting similar yet considerably lesser territory to his role in Rian Johnson’s stylish 2005 thriller Brick, plays a run-of-the-mill private detective named Nick who is called to investigate a seemingly cut-and-dried death on a Greek island. Leo (Richard Madden) has fallen off a steep mountain edge while free-climbing, a reckless accident to most but to his sister-in-law Penelope (Gordon-Levitt’s Snowden co-star Shailene Woodley), it looks like murder. She’s married to his identical twin brother and at the mercy of his wealthy, and dangerous, family.</p> <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/sep/26/killer-heat-review"">Continue reading...</a>",https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/sep/26/killer-heat-review,joseph gordonlevitt and shailene woodley star in a very boring murder mystery streaming on amazonwhat might seem like a relatively easy ask on paper  the director of a buzzy festival hit adapting a jo nesb short story with three likable and attractive actors set on the cameraready island of crete  has become a bizarrely effortful slog in the misshape of killer heat a dull and predictable sunshine noir that wastes the time of those involved as well as oursoriginally known as the far more appealing the jealousy man in print the anonymously retitled mystery plays less like a real movie and more like a caseoftheweek episode of an itv crime drama without credits its not even 90 minutes long joseph gordonlevitt revisiting similar yet considerably lesser territory to his role in rian johnsons stylish 2005 thriller brick plays a runofthemill private detective named nick who is called to investigate a seemingly cutanddried death on a greek island leo richard madden has fallen off a steep mountain edge while freeclimbing a reckless accident to most but to his sisterinlaw penelope gordonlevitts snowden costar shailene woodley it looks like murder shes married to his identical twin brother and at the mercy of his wealthy and dangerous family continue reading,accident
‘Neutrality isn’t just a stance’: the Red Cross mission to provide vital aid in areas of conflict,"<p>In conflict zones across the globe, people in desperate need have long relied on the hope that humanitarian aid, delivered by organisations such as the Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement, will reach them. Yet, this vital work is increasingly under threat, putting that hope in jeopardy</p><p>When communities are devastated by conflict or disaster, humanitarian workers risk their lives to deliver critical aid. This work is safeguarded by international humanitarian law (IHL), which mandates protection for aid organisations to ensure they can operate safely. The red cross and red crescent emblems are some of the most well-known examples of the protective power of IHL in action, and respect for them is crucial to the humanitarian mission of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement. However, a growing disregard for IHL is making it increasingly challenging for humanitarian organisations to deliver assistance to communities that urgently need it.</p><p>Adopted under the Geneva Conventions, the red cross and red crescent emblems are protective symbols under IHL, meaning those who display one or the other can expect safe passage in the world’s most hostile environments. However, numerous breaches of IHL have made headlines in recent years, with strikes on vehicles, buildings, and individuals bearing one of the emblems provoking global condemnation and risking serious legal consequences.</p><p>A Ukrainian Red Cross Society emergency team responds to shelling (top); the Italian Red Cross providing support in Ukraine.

10 things you didn’t know about the Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement,"<p>The Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement has been supporting people through conflicts, disasters and emergencies for more than 150 years. Read on to discover 10 inspiring facts about one of the world’s leading humanitarian organisations</p><p>The Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement started with the creation of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) in 1863, in response to the terrible human toll of the revolutionary conflicts raging in Europe in the second half of the 19th century. Seven years later the British Red Cross was established. Today, the Movement is active in 191 countries and has been a constant and reassuring presence at some of the world’s most harrowing events: from being among the first to provide humanitarian support after the liberation of the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp in 1945, to providing vital assistance to those affected by last year’s devastating earthquakes in Morocco, Turkey and Syria. You may know some of these facts, but did you know … <br /><br /><strong>1 The Red Cross’s ‘red cross’ is not a logo<br /></strong>Even though it is one of the most recognisable pieces of graphic design in the world, the red cross <a href=""https://eur03.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redcross.org.uk%2Femblem&amp;data=05%7C01%7COliviaJones%40redcross.org.uk%7C6cb09cee4ae84800102908dbd007ee6d%7Cfedc3cbaca5e4388a837b45c7f0d71b7%7C0%7C0%7C638332504716824623%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=F%2BA3VU1CfL0f7XHLjjMi365cpvnxnuOL0J0pLhglFK8%3D&amp;reserved=0"" rel=""nofollow"">emblem</a> is not just some clever bit of branding: it is a symbol of protection in armed conflict, the use of which is restricted by international law.

"Hope, finally? Keir Starmer’s first conference in power – podcast","<p>From anger over the winter fuel allowance to a row over freebies, Labour’s first conference in power for 15 years started under a cloud. Did the prime minister’s speech lift the gloom? With <strong>Jessica Elgot</strong></p><p>As the Labour party conference kicked off in Liverpool, the rain clouds gathered. Drenched delegates should have been celebrating at their first conference in power for 15 years. Instead, the mood was subdued after weeks of ministers hammering home their message that the Conservative party had left the country in a terrible economic state.
